    <h4>To get an icon of your booksona drawn, you have to: DM me an image of your booksona, and tell me what you want your booksona doing in the icon. If you don't specify what you want your booksona doing, I'll choose it myself >:]</h4>

    <h4>I will not draw anything bigoted/offensive, I will not draw anything NSFW, and you give me express permission to add the icon I draw onto this page.</h4>
